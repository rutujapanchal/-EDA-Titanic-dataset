Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset ðŸš¢

I recently completed an in-depth data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my data science skills and uncover interesting insights from this historical data.

1.Data Cleaning:

*Handled Missing Values: Addressed missing data for variables like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
*Feature Engineering: Created new features like 'Family Size' and 'Title' from existing data.
*Normalization: Standardized numerical features to ensure consistency.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

*Univariate Analysis: Examined the distribution of individual variables.
*Bivariate Analysis: Analyzed relationships between variables, such as survival rate by class, gender, and age.
*Multivariate Analysis: Utilized heatmaps and pair plots to explore correlations between multiple variables.

 Visualizations:
Created insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent survival rates, passenger demographics, and relationships between different features.
